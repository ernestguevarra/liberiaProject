# Coverage Assessment of Direct Nutrition Interventions in Liberia

For my code compendium, I am sharing my recent work in assessing coverage of direct nutrition interventions in Liberia.

As per instructions, I am providing a GitHub repository for the R package `liberiaData` that puts together all the data handling and data analysis that I performed for this project. The repository can be found at https://github.com/validmeasures/liberiaData. The README of the repository describes the package and the steps to take to replicate the analysis. The [website](https://validmeasures.org/liberiaData) of the package might also be a good entry point to the compendium as it presents the functions within the package in a more accessible way.

The repository should be sufficient as per instructions. For purposes of further reference, if helpful, I list out additional materials all available via GitHub. These may offer context to the work I present in the compendium including the project that I was evaluating and the methods I was using.
